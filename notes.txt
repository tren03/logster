run the docker container first
sudo docker run -rm -p 10000:10000 -name az_container mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite azurite-blob --blobHost 0.0.0.0

run the go program and wait for it to connect to the docker blob storage(should take about 1-2 seconds)
go build && ./logster

run this for benchmarking the webapp - This by default sends 1 lakh req in 5 seconds approx
for a successful run, we should see total blob size in the storage as 5900000
ab -p data.json -T 'application/json' -c 500 -n 100000 http://localhost:8080/log

to get the total blob storage after all upload, run this 
curl localhost:8080




NOW THAT WE HAVE MADE COMPOSE 
RUN 

sudo docker compose-up    : builds and runs the whole app


ab -p data.json -T 'application/json' -c 500 -n 100000 http://localhost:8080/log    :open another terminal in root of this proj and run this

each req when put into the blob is 58 Bytes


after the server processes everything, then run
curl localhost:8080     -> gets the total size of the blobs stored
